# MathMusical V2

Based on an ancient version of mathmusical, this time using neural networks.

The purpose of this codebase is to generate general purpose musical structures based on the conception of musical shapes that exist within music; in the previous version the notes were generated at random in a modular space; and then transformed with a "what may go next approach" and a solution picked on what was most likely, but it used heuristics and not NN; this solution will use neural networks for increased accuracy and a training set, but remain working within the rules of the modular space, therefore generating variations.
